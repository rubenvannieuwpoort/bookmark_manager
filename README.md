# Bookmark manager

Work in progress!

Simple extension to easily import collections of bookmarks. Written in Svelte. Currently only Chrome is supported.


## Building

npm run build
```

After building, the `public` folder can be imported by clicking 'load unpacked' in the 'manage extensions' view in Chrome.
