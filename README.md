# Bookmark manager

Work in progress!

Simple extension to easily import collections of bookmarks. Written in Svelte. Currently only Chrome is supported.


### Building

```
npm run build
```

After building, the `public` folder can be imported by clicking 'load unpacked' in the 'manage extensions' view in Chrome.


### To do
- Add types everywhere (yeah, I know, programming without types and then adding them later is kind of the wrong way around ðŸ˜…)
- Handle error paths
  - Handle invalid URL
  - Handle invalid JSON
- Remove bookmarks after toggling a collection to inactive
  - If this leaves an empty folder, remove this folder
- Build extension for other browsers
  - Find a good way to do this. In the best case just replacing `chrome` by `browser` should make the extension work for most browsers. Maybe [Mozilla's Browser API polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) can be used, but this feels like overkill if the same thing can be achieved by just replacing a single word in the source code... To be decided!
